# VyOS for Mono Gateway Development Kit (NXP LS1046A)

This repo builds VyOS for the aarch64 [Mono Gateway Development Kit](https://docs.mono.si/gateway-development-kit/hardware-description) based on latest [VyOS 'rolling' release](https://vyos.net/get/nightly-builds/). New [builds](https://github.com/mihakralj/vyos-ls1046a-build/releases) are released each Friday 01:00 UTC.

**This is the first and only VyOS build for bare-metal aarch64 networking hardware targeting support for both ASIC HW-offload *and* VPP.**

**The hardware earns the effort.** The Mono Gateway Development Kit is build around the [NXP LS1046A](https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/LS1046A.pdf) SoC - four Cortex-A72 cores at 1.6 GHz, with a hardware ASIC alongside which chews through packets before the CPU even notices they've arrived. The Mono Gateway Development Kit further adds 8 GB of ECC DDR4, three RJ45 ports, and two SFP+ cages - an ideal package for HW-offloaded, wire-speed networking on aarch64.

**Nothing in this class exists for use a home router,** and that gap is an opportunity. Historically, NXP sold the LS1046A SoC to telecoms carriers and switch vendors, alongside a generalised [Application Solutions Kit (ASK)](https://www.nxp.com/design/design-center/software/embedded-software/software-for-industrial-networking/gateway-ask:VORTIQA-ASK) to control the HW-offload network accelerator functions. In developing the Gateway Development Kit, Mono purchased and with permission, [released the ASK source](https://github.com/we-are-mono/ASK) under GPL v2.0. 

The LS1046A SoC uses the Data Path Acceleration Architecture (DPAA1), which defines the ASIC functions, and how they interoperate. 

**VyOS enables pushing this hardware to its full potential now aarch64 is becoming a first-class citizen in `1.5.x`.**  This repo documents the development of DPAA1/ASK HW-offloading rebuilt to modern standards as `ASK2`, and the compliment this can provide to Vector Packet Processing (VPP) on this HW.

## What This Build Actually Delivers

This is, as far as anyone can tell, the only VyOS build targeting bare-metal ARM64 networking hardware with HW offload and VPP. Some highlights from the wreckage:

- **10G SFP+ with VPP kernel bypass.** AF_XDP on eth3/eth4 polls at 2.47M packets/sec. The stock kernel path grinds through ~3-5 Gbps on those same ports. Not a typo.
- **CAAM hardware crypto.** IPsec AES-GCM offload via 3 Job Rings at ~2-3 Gbps encrypted throughput. WireGuard (ChaCha20-Poly1305) cannot use CAAM: it runs on ARM64 NEON SIMD instead, topping out around 1 Gbps. Pick your poison.
- **DPAA1 Frame Manager.** Five-port hardware packet engine handles parsing, core distribution, and buffer management before the CPU sees a single byte. Jumbo frames at 9578 MTU on RJ45. SFP+ ports cap at 3290 MTU under AF_XDP (DPAA1 XDP hard limit on `fsl_dpaa_mac`).
- **PTP hardware timestamping.** Nanosecond precision via `ptp_qoriq` on `/dev/ptp0`.
- **U-Boot direct boot.** `vyos.env` on the ext4 partition selects the active image. No GRUB, no OOM, no overhead. Image upgrades write the file automatically.
- **~80s cold boot to login prompt.** Single boot, no kexec double-reboot. `CONFIG_DEBUG_PREEMPT` suppressed saves ~20s of cosmetic scheduler spam.
- **HW-accelerated AF_XDP datapath.** The DPAA1 driver is modernized into a single shared kernel binary with `ndo_xsk_wakeup`, XSK-backed BMan pools, per-CPU NAPI on dedicated QMan channels, and FMan HW offloads (CC / HM / Policer / CEETM). The earlier DPDK DPAA PMD path was abandoned (RC#31: `dpaa_bus` probe globally disrupts kernel FMan interfaces); AF_XDP is the production kernel+VPP coexistence path. Design and milestone status: [specs/dpaa1-afxdp-modernization-spec.md](specs/dpaa1-afxdp-modernization-spec.md).

## Why VyOS?

**Zone-based firewall with nftables.** Interfaces join zones; policy applies per zone-pair. `set firewall zone DMZ from LAN firewall name LAN-DMZ-v4` replaces dozens of per-interface rules that multiply combinatorially as you add ports. Anyone who has managed large iptables rule sets knows exactly what that cost feels like.

**VPP userspace dataplane.** VyOS 1.5 ships VPP (Vector Packet Processing): a kernel-bypass data plane that batches 256 packets per poll cycle, reads hardware queues directly, and treats the Frame Manager as a co-processor. Critically, VPP is not all-or-nothing: only interfaces explicitly assigned to VPP use the VPP forwarding path. eth3/eth4 (10G SFP+) go to VPP; eth0-eth2 (RJ45) stay with the kernel for management and routing. VPP is off by default. See [plans/VPP.md](plans/VPP.md). The CAAM crypto engine provides 128 hardware algorithms for IPsec AES-GCM offload at ~2-3 Gbps encrypted.

**Native containerization via Podman.** Containers are first-class config-tree citizens: image, network, environment variables, volumes, ports, memory limits, all defined with `set container name ...` and committed alongside routing and firewall config. Run AdGuard, a monitoring agent, or a DDNS updater directly on the router. Roll it back if you regret it.

**CLI-first, text-based config.** The entire router state lives in `config.boot`: hierarchical, human-readable, diffable. A diff between two VyOS configs reads like plain English. No GUI-only system can match that at 2 AM when something is on fire.

**Transactional atomic commits.** Stage multiple changes, review with `compare`, apply with `commit`. If commit fails, nothing changes. `commit-confirm` provides automatic rollback on a timer. The number of network outages this design has prevented is unquantifiable. Use it.

**Full FRRouting integration.** BGP, OSPF, IS-IS, BFD, MPLS, VXLAN, segment routing, PIM: all in the config tree with proper dependency resolution at commit time. Full stack, no glue scripts, no surprises.
